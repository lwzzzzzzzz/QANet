    # Returns
        Integer (scalar), number of axes.

    ```python

        >>> inputs = K.placeholder(shape=(2, 4, 5))
        >>> val = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

    Batchwise dot product.

    `batch_dot` is used to compute dot product of `x` and `y` when
    `x` and `y` are data in batch, i.e. in a shape of
    `(batch_size, :)`.
    `batch_dot` results in a tensor or variable with less dimensions
    than the input. If the number of dimensions is reduced to 1,
    we use `expand_dims` to make sure that ndim is at least 2.

    # Arguments
        x: Keras tensor or variable with `ndim >= 2`.
        y: Keras tensor or variable with `ndim >= 2`.
        axes: list of (or single) int with target dimensions.
            The lengths of `axes[0]` and `axes[1]` should be the same.

    # Returns
        A tensor with shape equal to the concatenation of `x`'s shape
        (less the dimension that was summed over) and `y`'s shape
        (less the batch dimension and the dimension that was summed over).
        If the final rank is 1, we reshape it to `(batch_size, 1)`.
